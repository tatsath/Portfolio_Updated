## Introduction

Interpretability is often treated as a feature—something you add to models when needed. But as AI systems become more critical and complex, interpretability must evolve from a feature into infrastructure: a fundamental platform layer that enables reliable AI operations.

## Features vs Infrastructure

The distinction matters:

- **Features**: Optional additions that enhance functionality
- **Infrastructure**: Essential systems that enable everything else to work

Interpretability has been treated as a feature, but it should be infrastructure.

## Why Interpretability Must Be Infrastructure

Several factors drive this shift:

- **Production requirements**: Production systems need continuous monitoring and validation
- **Regulatory compliance**: Increasing regulations require explainability and transparency
- **Risk management**: Organizations need to understand and mitigate AI risks
- **Model development**: Teams need interpretability to improve models effectively

## What Infrastructure Means

Treating interpretability as infrastructure requires:

- **Always-on monitoring**: Continuous inspection of model behavior
- **Standardized interfaces**: Consistent APIs and tools across models
- **Scalable architecture**: Systems that work across model sizes and types
- **Integration with workflows**: Built into development and deployment pipelines

## The Platform Approach

NeuronLens provides interpretability as infrastructure through:

- **Unified evaluation framework**: One system for all evaluation needs
- **Mechanistic insights**: Deep understanding of model internals
- **Production-ready**: Fast, scalable, and reliable
- **Developer-friendly**: Easy integration into existing workflows

## The Future

As AI becomes more critical, interpretability infrastructure will be:

- **Standard practice**: Every production system will have interpretability built-in
- **Regulatory requirement**: Compliance will mandate interpretability infrastructure
- **Competitive advantage**: Teams with better interpretability will build better systems
- **Foundation for trust**: Enabling trustworthy AI at scale
